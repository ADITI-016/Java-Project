# Java-Project
The Java project is a basic grocery wallet system that applies fundamental Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, showcasing the use of classes, objects, methods, and constructors. It manages customer accounts for a grocery store, enabling operations such as shopping and recharging the account balance.  

It manages customer accounts for a grocery store, enabling operations such as shopping and recharging the account balance.

**Application of OOP Concepts**

**Classes and Objects**
The project consists of two main classes: grocery and main. The grocery class, within the functions package, represents a customer's account with attributes like name, ID, phone number, account balance, and address. An object of this class is instantiated in the main class to simulate grocery wallet interactions.

**Encapsulation**
Encapsulation is achieved by defining private attributes in the grocery class and providing public getter and setter methods, ensuring controlled access and modification. Methods like setCustomername, getCustomerId, and setAccbal maintain data integrity.

**Methods**
The grocery class includes shop and recharge methods to handle transactions. The shop method deducts a specified amount from the account balance if sufficient funds are available, while the recharge method adds a specified amount to the balance, updating and confirming the new balance.

**Practical Implementation**
In the main class, an instance of the grocery class is created, and customer details are set using setter methods. The system simulates transactions like shopping and recharging, demonstrating real-world applicability.

**Conclusion**
This project effectively demonstrates OOP principles in Java, ensuring a modular, maintainable, and scalable approach to software development. The use of classes and objects simplifies design and makes the code reusable and adaptable.
